sliding window --
 this pattern involves creating a windown which can either be an array or number from one position to another 

 depending on a certain condition , the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created) 
 very useful for keeping track of subset of data in an array /string etc

 * 
 * sliding windown technique use for solve problem with O(n) time complexity

jaise hame is arr me 0 index aur 1 index ka sum chahiye phir 1 and 2nd means 2 ,2 k pair me matlab sliding karte huye aage ja rahi hai 

that is why this is called sliding windows technique

we can say sliding windows some match with two pointer
