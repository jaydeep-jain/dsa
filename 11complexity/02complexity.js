/*
---There are multiple algorithm and you have to decide which one is better for your problem 

example -
 case - 1[jaise aapke friend ka ghar 200m. hai to aap kyu bike nikalege drive car karege parking ki problem bhi hogi to aap paidal jana chahege]

case -2[jaise aapke friend ka ghar 10km door hai to aapko bike se jana hi theek rahega]

case -3[aapke dost ka ghar hai to pas lekin aapko uske ghar 10 kg fruite le jane hai to aap bike ya car se jana pasand karoge itna weight nhi rakhoge apne pas]

** jaise yah case vaise hi algorithm hai aapko choose karna hai konsi algorithm aapke problem k liye best rahegi, like - pointers, recursion etc inme se aapko choose karna hai kounsi time aur space k sath sahi baithti hai **

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

jaise hame weight ko denote karna hota hai "W" se karte hai , speed ko "V" se karte hai usi tarike se jab hame algorithm ki complexity denote karni hoti hai to ham laga dete hai Big O(this is universal standard)

what is Asymptotic Analysis ?

 when you have to more method to do any program this help you which one you have to use for efficiect programing as well as inside it calculate time and space complexity and asymptotic Nootations also come.
