/*

space complexity - space complexity is the amount of space required to solve a problem
space complexity = auxiliary space + input space(size) 

now question what is input space => so input space is ki you have a program which have 10 variables and their total size 1 KB also you use array and when define 10000 values also use and many more things and in sab ko calculate kar ke define karte.

jaise ek program hai jiski time complexity 5mb and another one has 10mb so better 5mb bala hua kyuki yah kam space le raha hai.
